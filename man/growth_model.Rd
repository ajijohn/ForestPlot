\title{Model tree growth}
\usage{
growth_model(training, outcome_var, focal_sps)
}
\arguments{
\item{training}{A dataframe containing a separate row for each focal x
neighbor tree pair and a column for each variable to include in the
model, including the outcome variable. Outcome variable must be numeric,
other variables can be of any type, including character. Character variables
will be converted to factors before fitting the model.}

\item{outcome_var}{Name of column in \code{training} containing the outcome
variable, provided as a string.}

\item{focal_sps}{Name of species for which growth should be modeled,
provided as a string.}
}
\value{
A list containing four elements: \code{mod} is the fitted glmnet
object, \code{obs_pred} is a dataframe containing observed and predicted 
growth, \code{R_squared} is the coefficient of determination, \code{mod_coef}
is a matrix containing the explanatory variables and their fitted
coefficients. These elements can be called with e.g. \code{$R_squared}.
}
\description{
Fits a regularized linear regression model of tree growth for a single
species, returning the model object, growth predictions, the coefficient
of determination, and the fitted model coefficients.
}
\details{
All variables other than the indicated outcome variable are included as
explanatory variables in the model. Regularized regression model is fitted
using the glmnet package. Predictions, R-squared, and model coefficients
returned are all based on the \code{"lambda.1se"} model but all models with
different lambda values are included in the returned mod object - see glmnet 
documentation for details.
